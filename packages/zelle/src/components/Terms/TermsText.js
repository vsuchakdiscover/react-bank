          Funds from <em>Zelle </em>transfers<em> </em>to your Send To Account
          will generally be available for withdrawal or transfer on the Business
          Day that we receive and credit them to your Send To Account. The
          availability of funds may, in our discretion, be delayed for a longer
          period of time if we suspect fraud, transfers in violation of this
          Agreement, or other unusual activity, or as required by legal or
          regulatory obligations. For more information on availability of
          deposited funds generally, see Section 15 of the Deposit Account
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Receiving Money; Money Transfers by Participating Banks</h2>
        <p>
          Once a User initiates a transfer of money to your email address or
          mobile phone number enrolled with the Service, you have no ability to
          stop the transfer. By using the Service, you agree and authorize us to
          initiate credit transfers to your Send To Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most transfers of money to you from other Users will occur within
          minutes. Please note that, on occasion, a transfer to your Send To
          Account may take up to 3 Business Days. There may be other
          circumstances when the transfer may take longer. For example, in order
          to protect you, us, <em>Zelle </em>
          and the other Participating Banks<em>, </em>we may need or{" "}
          <em>Zelle </em>
          may need additional time to verify your identity or the identity of
          the individual sending the money. We, <em>Zelle</em>, or another
          Participating Bank may also delay or block the transfer to prevent
          fraud or to meet legal or regulatory obligations. If we delay or block
          a transfer that you have initiated through a request for money, we
          will notify you through email or text message in accordance with your
          user preferences. Funds will be credited to your Send To Account on
          the day we receive them and will be available for withdrawal as set
          forth in Section 7 above.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may return any transfer to the sending Participating Bank, at any
          time and in our sole discretion, if either:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. we are unable to establish that you are the intended recipient of
          the transfer;
        </p>
        <p>
          b. you do not enroll with the <em>Zelle</em> P2P Service the specific
          email address or telephone number the sending User has provided to us
          for you;
        </p>
        <p>
          c. we reasonably believe that completing the transfer would violate
          any applicable law or regulation;
        </p>
        <p>
          d. we are advised that either the Participating Bank, the User
          initiating the transfer, or the owner of the account from which the
          payment was made, has alleged that the transfer was fraudulent or
          unauthorized; or
        </p>
        <p>
          e. you do not identify a Send To Account within a reasonable time, not
          to exceed 14 calendar days starting with the day you are sent notice
          of a pending transfer or your Send To Account is closed for any
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that you are responsible for the full amount of any transfer
          we credit to your Send To Account which is later reversed for any
          reason. You agree that we may withdraw the full amount, or any
          portion, of any reversed or disputed transfer, plus any applicable
          fees, from your Send To Account or from any other account you have
          with us, without prior notice to you. You agree that you, and not we,
          will be responsible for resolving any payment dispute with any User
          from whom you receive money through the <em>Zelle</em> P2P Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>9. </strong>
          <strong> Requesting Money</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may request money from another User or from multiple Users. You
          understand and acknowledge that Users to whom you send transfer
          requests may reject or ignore your request. Neither we nor{" "}
          <em>Zelle </em>guarantee that you will receive money from other Users
          by sending a transfer request, or that you will receive the amount
          that you request. Neither we nor <em>Zelle </em>accept responsibility
          if the other User rejects or ignores your request, or sends you an
          amount that is different than you request. If a User ignores your
          request, we or <em>Zelle </em>may decide, in our sole discretion, that
          we will not send a reminder or repeat request to that User.
        </p>
        <p>You agree not to engage in the business of debt collection by:</p>
        <p>
          a. attempting to use the Service to request money for the payment or
          collection of an overdue or delinquent debt;
        </p>
        <p>b. requesting money that is owed to another person; or</p>
        <p>
          c. collecting any amounts that are owed pursuant to a court order.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless <em>Zelle</em>, other
          Participating Banks, and us and each of our respective owners,
          directors, officers, and agents from and against all claims, losses,
          expenses, damages and costs (including, but not limited to, direct,
          incidental, consequential, exemplary and indirect damages), and
          reasonable attorney fees, resulting from or arising out of any request
          for money that you send that is related to overdue or delinquent
          amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to receive money requests from other Users, and to only send
          requests for legitimate and lawful purposes. Requests for money are
          solely between the sending User and receiving User and are not
          reviewed or verified by us or by <em>Zelle</em>. Neither we nor{" "}
          <em>Zelle </em>assume responsibility for the accuracy or legality of
          such requests and do not act as a debt collector on your behalf or on
          behalf of the sender of a request for money. We reserve the right, but
          assume no obligation, to terminate your ability to send requests for
          money in general, or to specific recipients, if we deem such requests
          to be potentially unlawful, abusive, offensive or unwelcome by the
          recipient.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Sending Money at Your or Another User's Request</h2>
        <p>
          You may send money to another User at your request or in response to
          that User's request, as provided in this <em>Zelle</em> Agreement, for
          money up to the available balance in your Send From Account, subject
          to the limits set forth in Section 11(a). Your use of this Service by
          you shall at all times be subject to your express authorization at the
          time of the transaction for us to initiate a debit transfer from your
          Send From Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you submit a transfer request, you will not be able to modify it.
          You understand that when you send the TRANSFER TO ANOTHER USER, you
          will have no ability to stop it. If the PERSON you sent money to has
          already ENROLLED (MEANING REGISTERED AND COMPLETED VERIFICATION) with{" "}
          <em>Zelle</em>, either in the <em>Zelle </em>mobile app or with a
          Participating Bank, the money is sent directly to their bank account
          (except as otherwise provided below) and may not be STOPPED, canceled
          or revoked. If you send money to a person who has not completed
          enrollment with <em>Zelle</em>, then the funds will remain in your
          Send From Account until they enroll. If they do not timely enroll, the
          transfer request will expire. However, once you schedule the transfer
          request, you will not be able to cancel it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, when you are sending money to another User, the
          transfer will occur in minutes; however, there are circumstances when
          the transfer may take longer. For example, in order to protect you,
          us, <em>Zelle </em>
          and the other Participating Banks<em>, </em>we may need additional
          time to verify your identity or the identity of the individual
          receiving the money. If you are sending money to someone who has not
          enrolled as a User with <em>Zelle</em>, either in the <em>Zelle </em>
          mobile app or with a Participating Bank, they will receive a text or
          email message instructing them on how to enroll to receive the money.
          You understand and acknowledge that an individual to whom you are
          sending money and who is not enrolled as a User may fail to register
          with <em>Zelle</em>, or otherwise ignore the payment notification, and
          the transfer may not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The money may also be delayed or the transfer may be blocked to
          prevent fraud or comply with regulatory or legal requirements. If we
          delay or block a payment that you have initiated, we will notify you
          in accordance with your user preferences (i.e. email or text message).
          We have no control over the actions of other Users, other
          Participating Banks or other financial institutions that could delay
          or prevent your money from being delivered to the intended User.

        <p>
          Your ability to send transfers through the <em>Zelle </em>P2P Service
          is limited by applicable law and other limits as set forth in this

          You may send a total of $600 per day in <em>Zelle</em> transfers to
          other users. We may increase your transfer limit for sending money,
          from time to time, based on a variety of factors that we determine in
          our sole discretion. If we increase your transfer limit for sending
          money, we will let you know. We may also decrease your transfer limits
          or set additional limits, including limits for various types of
          transactions or accounts, at any time in our sole discretion. If we
          decrease your limits or set additional limits, we will notify you in
          accordance with the Account Center Agreement and as required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not be able to send or receive a transfer that exceeds the
          limits we establish. If you exceed your transfer limits for sending
          money, you may make payments and transfers using other methods, such
          as through the Discover Bill Payment Service, writing a check, or
          sending a wire transfer, subject to the terms and conditions for those
          methods.

          or we reasonably believe involves an illegal or improper purpose or
          activity, (ii) exceeds the available funds in your Send From Account,
          (iii) we have reason to believe may not be authorized by you, (iv)
          involves funds subject to a hold, dispute or legal process, (v) would

          in accord with any other requirements stated in this Agreement or the

          In order for you to use the <em>Zelle </em>P2P Service, we share
          information regarding your Enrolled Account, requests and/or transfers
          with <em>Zelle</em>, other Participating Banks, and other third

          18. Error Resolution Regarding <em>Zelle</em> Transfers
        </h2>
        <p>
          In case of errors or questions about <em>Zelle</em> transfers, call us
          or write us as soon as you can, if you think your statement is wrong
          or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the
          statement. Call 1-800-347-7000, or send your inquiry to us at Discover
          Bank, PO Box 30411, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0411. We must hear from
          you no later than 120 days starting with the transaction date at
          issue. Tell us your name and account number (if any). Describe the
          error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain it as clearly
          as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more
          information. Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. If you
          tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or
          question in writing within 10 Business Days. We will determine whether
          an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and
          will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may
          take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we
          decide to do this, we will credit your Send From Account within 10
          Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will
          have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our
          investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in
          writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not
          credit your Send From Account while we complete our investigation. For
          errors involving new Send From Accounts, we may take up to 90 days to
          investigate your complaint or question and we may take up to 20
          Business Days to credit your account while we investigate, for the
          amount you think is in error. We will tell you the results within
          three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide
          that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You
          may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

        <p>
          You are responsible for all requests and <em>Zelle</em> transfers you
          make using the Service. If you authorize other persons to use your
          User ID or password, you are responsible for all requests and{" "}
          <em>Zelle</em> transfers they make from your Enrolled Accounts. You
          are liable for all transfers that you make or are made by any such
          person, even if such person exceeds the authority you gave them, until
          you notify us that the other person is no longer authorized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that your password has been stolen,
          someone has logged in to the Account Center without your permission,
          or a <em>Zelle</em> transfer has been sent from your Account without
          your permission, by calling us at 1-800-347-7000, or by writing us at
          Discover Bank, PO Box 30411, Salt Lake City, UT 84130- 0411.
          Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down.
          Also, if your statement shows <em>Zelle</em> transfers that you did
          not make or authorize someone else to make, tell us AT ONCE. If you do
          not tell us within 120 days starting with the transaction date at
          issue, you may not get back any of the money you lost after the 120
          days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking
          the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason, such as a long
          trip or a hospital stay, kept you from telling us, we will extend the
          time periods for a reasonable amount of time.
